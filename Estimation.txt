Engineering Estimation Assignment
1.
a) The height of a nearby tall tree on campus
10 - 100 feet
b) The mass of a car
1000 - 10000 pounds
c) The number of water drops in a bathtub
100000 - 1000000 drops
d) The amount of money spent in Curry Student Center food court at lunch on Wednesday
1000 - 10000 dollars
e) The number of undergraduate students in Massachusetts
100000 - 1000000 students
2. Air mass in FYELIC
the FYELIC is about 100x200 ft, and about 12 feet tall
that gives an area of 240000 ft cubed
air has a density of 0.75 lb per foot
giving 180,000 lb mass
Variance: 100,000-1,000,000
3. Bandwidth of a 747 crossing the Atlantic full of CDs
A 747 is approximately 20 feet tall and 200 feet long
Each CD is 0.01 inches thick and 5 inches in diameter with a density of 1.22 g/cm
Thus 80,000 CDs can fit into the 747
Each CD holds 5GB of data
Thus 400,000 GB can be transported at a time
Variance: 100,000 - 1,000,000 GB
Thus 566990460 GB can be moved by the plane per trip
A transatlantic cable can accomodate 60000 GB per second
It would take 9450 seconds for the cable to transmit the same amount of data as the plane
4. The orbital period near the Earth's surface is roughly 1.5 hours. Estimate the distance to the moon.
The earth is approximately 13000 km in diameter and 1.3e24 pounds
The moon is approximately 1.7e23 pounds
The orbital period of the moon is approximately 29 days
Thus the diameter of the orbit is approximately 400,000 km
Variance: 100,000 - 1,000,000 km
5. The 2018 Boston Marathon has ~30000 registered runners, how many toilets will be needed for the event.
Each use of the bathroom takes an approximate average of one minute
If one in every two people uses the bathroom, it would take 15000 minutes for one bathroom
With 1500 bathrooms it would take 10 minutes, so assuming that it 5 minutes is an ok wait time
If one in eight use the bathroom at a time, there should be 750 bathrooms total
